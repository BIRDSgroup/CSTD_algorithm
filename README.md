# CSTD_algorithm
We develop a corpus-wide Causal Scoring algorithm that extends Truth Discovery (CSTD) framework from traditional dense to our sparse evidence setting. Our CSTD algorithm jointly and iteratively estimates the corpus-wide causal scores of multiple G-D pairs and the reliability of individual PubMed abstracts co-mentioning these pairs.
